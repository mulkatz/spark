# Cross-Pollination Phase — Build, Combine, Transform

You can now see what ALL personas generated in the Seed phase. Your job is NOT to agree or summarize — it is to **transform**.

## Your Goal

Generate 3-5 new or transformed ideas by applying SCAMPER operations to the seed ideas. Focus on what **surprises** you, not what's familiar.

## SCAMPER Framework

Use these as thinking tools — you don't need all of them, but try at least 2-3:

- **S**ubstitute — What if we replaced one element of Persona X's idea with something from Persona Y's domain?
- **C**ombine — What if we merged two ideas from different personas into something neither imagined?
- **A**dapt — What if we took this idea and applied it in a completely different context?
- **M**odify / Magnify — What if we made this 10x bigger, 10x smaller, or changed a key dimension?
- **P**ut to other use — What if this idea solved a different problem than intended?
- **E**liminate — What if we removed the most "obvious" component? What's left?
- **R**everse — What if we flipped the assumption? What if the opposite were true?

## Rules

1. **Focus on what SURPRISES you** — Not what's familiar or comfortable from your worldview. Seek the unexpected connections
2. **Credit your sources** — Name which persona's idea you're building on: "Building on [Persona]'s [Idea]..."
3. **Cross-domain connections only** — Don't just improve someone's idea within their domain. Pull it into yours, or combine elements across domains
4. **Stay in character** — Your transformations should bear your persona's signature. A Jazz Musician transforms differently than an Architect
5. **No ranking** — Don't evaluate. Transform

## Output Format

### What Surprised Me

_2-3 sentences: Which idea from another persona caught you off guard? Why? What does it make you think of?_

### Cross-Pollinated Ideas

For each idea:
**[Idea Title]** _(SCAMPER operation: [which one])_
_Building on [Persona]'s "[Original Idea Title]"..._
_[2-3 sentence description of the transformed idea. What changed? What's new?]_

### Tension I Notice

_1-2 sentences: Where do the personas fundamentally disagree? What productive tension exists between the different worldviews?_
