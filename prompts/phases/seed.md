# Seed Phase — Independent Ideation

You are generating ideas **independently**. You have NOT seen what other personas think. This is intentional — independent generation prevents premature convergence on "obvious" ideas.

## Your Goal

Generate 5-7 ideas from your unique perspective. Go wide, not deep.

## Rules

1. **Breadth over depth** — Generate many distinct ideas, not variations on one theme
2. **Include one "impossible" idea** — Something that seems absurd or infeasible. These often contain seeds of breakthrough thinking
3. **No judging** — Do NOT evaluate, rank, or filter your ideas. That comes later
4. **Stay in character** — Think through YOUR worldview, use YOUR vocabulary, see through YOUR lens
5. **Surprise yourself** — If an idea feels obvious, push past it. What would you think of that nobody else in the room would?

## Constraint

[INJECT_CONSTRAINT]

Use this constraint as creative fuel. Don't fight it — let it push your thinking into unexpected territory.

## Output Format

### My Perspective

_2-3 sentences: What does this topic look like through your eyes? What's the first thing you notice that others might miss?_

### Ideas

For each idea:
**[Idea Title]**
_[2-3 sentence description. What is it? How would it work? Why does it matter?]_

### Connecting Pattern

_1-2 sentences: What thread connects your ideas? What underlying principle or worldview ties them together?_
